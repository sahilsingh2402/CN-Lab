Lab 1: (18.07.22)<br>
1. Write a C program to swap the content of 2 variables using pointer.<br>
2. Write a C program to assign values to each members of the following structure. Pass the populated structure to a function Using call-by address and print the value of each member of the structure with in that function.<br>
3. Write a C program to extract each byte from a given number and store them in separate character variables and print the content of those variables.<br>
4. Write a C Program to enter a number and store the number across the following structure and print the content of each member of the structure. Then aggregate each member of the structure to form the original number and print the same.<br>
5. Write a C program to check whether the Host machine is in Little Endian or Big Endian. Enter a number, print the content of each byte location and Convert the Endianness of the same i.e. Little to Big Endian and vice-versa.<br>

<br>
Lab 5: (29.08.22) <br>
1. Using TCP socket client should send an unsorted array containg elements(30,10,50,8,9,20) to server. Server will sort this and send back to client.<br>
<br>
Lab 6: (05.09.22)<br>
1. Write the client side and server side program with command line arguments for connection-oriented socket using C where both of them will exchange messages with each other. If any of them will receive the “exit” message from the other end then both of them will close the connection.<br>
<br>
Lab 7: (10.10.22)<br>
1. Write the client side and server side of a connection oriented socket where the server will behave as a chat server serving multiple chart clients. When the chat server receives a “logout” message from a particular client then it terminate the respective connection with that client.<br>
<br>
Lab 8: (17.10.22)<br>
1. IO Multiplexing. Check if there is an input from stdin, if there is no input, print "No Data" otherwise print the input.<br>
<br>
Lab 9: (31.10.22)<br>
